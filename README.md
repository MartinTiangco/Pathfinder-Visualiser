# Pathfinder-Visualiser
Hey, I'm Martin Tiangco! Thanks for looking at my project!

## Live Demo
The Pathfinder Visualiser can be viewed on [this](https://martintiangco.github.io/Pathfinder-Visualiser/) page.

## What is this project?
This project is a visualisation of pathfinding algorithms present in many software applications. The pathfinding algorithms in this project include Breadth-first Search, Depth-first Search and Dijkstra's Algorithm, with more to come in the future. Some practical uses for pathfinding algorithms include video game pathfinding, Google Maps and the internet.

### Features:
- Responsive design for the grid and components - try it out on mobile, tablet and desktop!
- Can generate random walls or draw them
- Can drag the start and finish (on desktop)

### Currently implemented algorithms:
- Djikstra's Algorithm - guaranteed the shortest path!
- Breadth-first Search - guaranteed the shortest path (unweighted)
- Depth-first Search

### Future works:
- Generation of mazes with famous algorithms such as Kruskal and Prim
- More pathfinding algorithms such as A*

## Motivation
I created this project with large inspiration from Clement Mihailescu. After watching his videos, I decided to give this a try - here is the finished product! I am very proud of the application and had a lot of fun building it, and I hope you have a fun time messing around with it. 

## Tech Stack
### Languages/Frameworks:
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Used the popular library for JavaScript ReactJS.
- GitHub, deployed on GitHub pages.

### Additional libraries:
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for the different components e.g. navbar, buttons, etc.
