# Pathfinder-Visualiser
Hey, I'm Martin Tiangco! Thanks for looking at my project!

### What is this project?
This project is a visualisation of pathfinding algorithms present in many software applications. The pathfinding algorithms in this project include Breadth-first Search, Depth-first Search and Dijkstra's Algorithm, with more to come in the future. Some practical uses for pathfinding algorithms include Google Maps and the internet.

I created this project with large inspiration from Clement Mihailescu. After watching his videos, I decided to give this a try - here is the finished product! I had a lot of fun building it, and I hope you have a fun time messing around with it.
